Created for learning purposes.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n- Configurable color, size, font, and animation\r\n- Custom seating layout\r\n- Custom seating rule\r\n- Open database from file, in-program\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n- C++ >= 4.3.2\r\n- Qt4\r\n\r\nTested on Linux 3.11-2-686-pae #1 SMP Debian 3.11.8-1 (2013-11-13) i686 GNU/Linux (LMDE)\r\n\r\n## Compiling & Running\r\n```sh\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/rkkautsar/QTempatDuduk\t# ignore this if you download the zip/tar\r\n$ cd QTempatDuduk\t\t\t\t\t# go to the project directory\r\n$ qmake\r\n$ make\r\n$ ./QTempatDuduk\r\n```\r\nIf you get an error, try using `qmake-qt4` instead.\r\n\r\n## Configuration Files\r\n### people.txt\r\nThey are the names for the seating layout. Here's the template:\r\n```\r\n[number of male]\r\nAlpha\r\nBeta\r\nGamma\r\n.\r\n.\r\n\r\n[number of female]\r\nAlpha\r\nBeta\r\nGamma\r\n.\r\n.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### seating.txt\r\nThis is the custom rule and layout configuration, it is really not complicated to edit it or make a new layout and rule entirely. This is the template:\r\n```\r\n[number of male] [number of female]\r\n[number of row] [number of column]\r\n[The layout and rule]\r\n```\r\nA little example before we go further:\r\n```\r\n18 17\r\n9 11\r\nmm.ff.mm.mm\r\n...........\r\nff.mm.ff.mm\r\n...........\r\nmm.ff.mm.ff\r\n...........\r\nff.mm.ff.mm\r\n...........\r\n....fff....\r\n```\r\nThe layout and rule section is a mapping or matrix `[number of row] x [number of column]` of characters. The accepted characters are `{'.','m','f'}`. `'.'` represents a space, `'m'` represents a seat that should be seated by a male, and `'f'` represents a seat that should be seated by a female. You should at dots between rows too so there is a space between seating rows.\r\n\r\n## Precompiled Binaries\r\n - [Windows 32-bit](https://github.com/rkkautsar/QTempatDuduk/releases/download/v1.4/QTempatDuduk-v1.4.win32.zip), tested on Wine-1.4.1","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
