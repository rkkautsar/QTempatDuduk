QTempatDuduk
============

A QT4 app to randomize seating. Created for learning purposes.

## Configuration
Just edit `male.txt` and `female.txt` to change names
For seating layout, you have to change it manually in the code, as I'm still learning QT and can't implement this feature yet. Sorry :'(

## Instalation (Linux)
	qmake
	make
If you get an error, try using `qmake-qt4` instead.
