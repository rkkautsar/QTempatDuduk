Sorry :'(\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n- C++ >= 4.3.2\r\n- Qt4\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n```sh\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/rkkautsar/QTempatDuduk\r\n$ cd QTempatDuduk\r\n$ qmake\r\n$ make\r\n$ ./QTempatDuduk\r\n```\r\nIf you get an error, try using `qmake-qt4` instead.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
